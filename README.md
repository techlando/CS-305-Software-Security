## CS-305-Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial services company seeking to enhance the security of their web-based software application. Their primary requirement was to ensure secure communications for sensitive client and financial data. They specifically wanted to implement a file verification step within their software to validate file integrity and reduce the risk of unauthorized data alterations.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I systematically identified vulnerabilities by applying secure coding best practices and using assessment tools, ensuring I documented each finding thoroughly. Secure coding is crucial to protect sensitive data, reduce the risk of breaches, and maintain client trust. For a company like Artemis Financial, strong software security enhances its reputation, safeguards against potential liabilities, and promotes sustainable operations.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part was prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk level and impact. This aspect of the assessment was also highly informative, as it required a careful balance of urgency and practicality in remediation planning. Identifying high-risk areas was particularly helpful in understanding how different vulnerabilities could compromise the application.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I incorporated multiple security layers, including checksum validation, encryption, and strict input validation. Moving forward, I would use established frameworks like the OWASP Top Ten for structured assessments and automated vulnerability scanning tools to quickly identify and rank threats. This approach helps ensure that security measures align with industry standards and address the most critical issues.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring, I validated the application’s functionality through comprehensive testing, which included static and dynamic analysis. I also ran additional vulnerability scans post-refactoring to confirm that the new code maintained or improved security without introducing new issues. This process ensured the application remained both effective and resilient against threats.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized secure coding libraries, static and dynamic analysis tools, and resources like the OWASP guidelines. These tools helped streamline the assessment and remediation processes and will be valuable in future assignments that require secure development practices.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a vulnerability assessment, apply secure coding practices, and follow industry guidelines. I would showcase this assignment as an example of my skills in identifying and mitigating software vulnerabilities, performing risk analysis, and implementing secure coding solutions that enhance software integrity and reliability.
